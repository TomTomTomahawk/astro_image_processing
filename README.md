# Astrophotography image processing

3rd year Astrophysics lab where images from a telescope were processed to form a calibrated image using stack frames and removing the bias (camera electronic noise), dark (thermal noise associated with the sensor) and using the flat (median of single exposures of a homogeneously and non-saturating illuminated area).
